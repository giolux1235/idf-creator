# üöÇ Railway Deployment Instructions

## Ready to Deploy!

Your IDF Creator is ready for Railway. Follow these steps:

---

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub CLI (If installed)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not installed
# brew install gh (on Mac)

# Create repo
gh repo create idf-creator --public --source=. --remote=origin

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: Manual GitHub Creation

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create new repository named `idf-creator`
3. **Don't** initialize with README (we have one)
4. Copy the commands and run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/idf-creator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### Via Railway Dashboard:

1. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app
2. **Sign up** with GitHub
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose your repo** (`idf-creator`)
6. **Railway auto-detects and deploys!** ‚ú®

### Via Railway CLI:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Initialize and deploy
railway init
railway up
```

---

## Step 3: Add Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here (optional, for LLM features)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key (optional, for Claude)
```

**Note**: Railway automatically sets `PORT` - don't set it manually.

---

## Step 4: Get Your URL

Railway provides a public URL like:
```
https://idf-creator-production.up.railway.app
```

Share this with users!

- `railway.json` - Railway config
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `web_interface.py` - Web app

---

## Testing After Deployment

1. Open your Railway URL
2. Enter building description
3. Add documents (optional)

## Commands Summary

```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/idf-creator.git
git push -u origin main

# 2. Deploy to Railway (via dashboard at railway.app)

# 3. Monitor
railway logs  # Via CLI
# Or check dashboard for logs
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
- Check `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies
- Railway installs from requirements.txt automatically

### App won't start
- Check logs: `railway logs`
- Verify `Procfile` content
- Ensure port is from env var, not hardcoded

### Files not persisting
- Railway resets files between deploys
- Use Railway Volumes for persistence
- Or store files in external storage
