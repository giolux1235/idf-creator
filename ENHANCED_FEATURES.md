# ✨ Enhanced IDF Creator - New Features

## 🚀 What's New

Your IDF Creator now uses **THREE FREE APIs** to gather much better building data:

### 1. **OpenStreetMap Overpass API** 🗺️
- **What it does:** Gets actual building footprints and geometry
- **Data retrieved:**
  - Building outline/polygon
  - Number of stories/levels
  - Building height
  - Roof shape and material
  - Building type classification
  - Area estimates
- **Cost:** FREE
- **API:** OpenStreetMap Overpass Turbo

### 2. **NREL NSRDB (Weather Data)** 🌤️
- **What it does:** Suggests best weather file for location
- **Data retrieved:**
  - Appropriate EPW weather file
  - Weather station description
  - Download URLs for weather files
- **Cost:** FREE (NREL government data)
- **API:** NREL National Solar Radiation Database

### 3. **Census Bureau API** 📊
- **What it does:** Gets building demographics (placeholder)
- **Future data:**
  - Median year built by area
  - Building type distributions
  - Average square footage
- **Cost:** FREE (government data)
- **Status:** Framework ready, needs full implementation

## 🆕 New Files Created

```
src/
├── osm_fetcher.py                  # OpenStreetMap integration
├── nrel_fetcher.py                 # NREL weather data
├── census_fetcher.py               # Census data (framework)
└── enhanced_location_fetcher.py    # Combines all APIs
```

## 🎯 How to Use

### Enhanced Mode (Default)
```bash
python main.py "Empire State Building, New York, NY"
```

**What happens:**
1. ✨ Uses Enhanced Location Fetcher
2. 🗺️ Fetches building footprint from OSM
3. 🌤️ Gets weather data from NREL
4. 📍 Geocodes address
5. 🏗️ Generates IDF with real building data

### Basic Mode (Original)
```bash
python main.py --basic-mode "Empire State Building, New York, NY"
```

**What happens:**
1. Uses original simple geocoding only
2. Basic climate zone determination
3. Standard IDF generation

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Basic Mode)
```
Input: "Empire State Building"
Output:
  - Location: lat/lon ✓
  - Climate zone: calculated
  - Building: estimated from user params
```

### After (Enhanced Mode)
```
Input: "Empire State Building"
Output:
  - Location: lat/lon ✓
  - Climate zone: calculated ✓
  - Building footprint: from OSM ✓
  - Building height: from OSM ✓
  - Number of stories: from OSM ✓
  - Area: calculated from footprint ✓
  - Weather file: NREL recommended ✓
  - Building type: from OSM ✓
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
python test_enhanced.py
```

This will test both enhanced and basic modes.

## 💡 Example Output

```
✨ Using ENHANCED mode with multiple free APIs!
📍 Fetching comprehensive data for: Empire State Building, New York, NY
✓ Geocoded: 40.748, -73.986
✓ Climate zone: ASHRAE_C4
🗺️  Fetching building footprint from OpenStreetMap...
✓ Found building in OSM
  - Type: skyscraper
  - Levels: 102
  - Area: 45206.0 m²
✓ Weather file: New York LaGuardia Airport
```

## 🎁 Benefits

### 1. **More Accurate Geometry**
- Real building footprints instead of estimates
- Actual dimensions from OpenStreetMap

### 2. **Better Climate Data**
- NREL-recommended weather files
- Proper EPW file selection

### 3. **Automatic Building Detection**
- Fetches building characteristics automatically
- No need to specify everything manually

### 4. **Cost: $0**
- All APIs are free or have generous free tiers
- No API keys required for basic use

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Add optional API keys to `.env` for enhanced features:
```env
NREL_API_KEY=your_key_here
CENSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Even without keys, most features work!

## 📈 What's Next

### Immediate Improvements Available:
- ⚠️ Add rate limiting for API calls
- ⚠️ Cache OSM results locally
- ⚠️ Improve weather file matching accuracy
- ⚠️ Add more cities to weather database

### Future Enhancements:
- Add Google Maps API for even better footprints
- Integrate AI vision for document parsing
- Add building permit data
- Integrate actual Census data queries
