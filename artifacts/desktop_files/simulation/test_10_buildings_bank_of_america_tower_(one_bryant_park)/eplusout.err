   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed "LOBBY_0_Z1_COOLINGCOILDX" - Full load outlet air dry-bulb temperature < 2C. This indicates the possibility of coil frost/freeze. Outlet temperature = -47.15 C.
   **   ~~~   **  ...Occurrence info = YEAR ROUND RUN PERIOD, 03/10 12:30 - 12:45
   **   ~~~   ** ... Possible reasons for low outlet air dry-bulb temperatures are: This DX coil
   **   ~~~   **    1) may have a low inlet air dry-bulb temperature. Inlet air temperature = 24.195 C.
   **   ~~~   **    2) may have a low air flow rate per watt of cooling capacity. Check inputs.
   **   ~~~   **    3) is used as part of a HX assisted cooling coil which uses a high sensible effectiveness. Check inputs.
