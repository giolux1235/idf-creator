# Current Status - Energy Results Extraction

## Test Date: 2025-11-04 18:35

## API Response

```json
{
  "version": "33.0.0",
  "simulation_status": "error",
  "energyplus_version": "25.1.0",
  "real_simulation": true,
  "error_message": "EnergyPlus ran but produced no energy results...",
  "error_file_content": "",
  "output_files": [
    {"name": "eplusout.sql", "size": 180224}
  ]
}
```

## Status: ❌ **Still No Energy Results**

### What We Have:
- ✅ SQLite file exists: 180,224 bytes (176 KB)
- ✅ Simulation runs successfully
- ✅ API responds correctly

### What's Missing:
- ❌ No `energy_results` field in response
- ❌ `simulation_status` still shows `"error"`
- ❌ SQLite extraction not working or not deployed

## Possible Issues

### 1. Implementation Not Deployed
- Code may not be deployed to Railway yet
- Need to verify deployment status

### 2. Extraction Logic Error
- SQLite extraction might be failing silently
- Queries might not match the database schema
- Need error logging to see what's happening

### 3. Database Schema Mismatch
- SQLite file might have different table structure
- Queries might need adjustment
- Need to inspect actual database schema

### 4. Empty Database
- SQLite file exists but might be empty
- EnergyPlus might not have written data
- Need to verify database has records

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Check Deployment Status**
   - Verify the updated code is deployed to Railway
   - Check Railway logs for any errors

2. **Add Error Logging**
   - Log when SQLite extraction is attempted
   - Log any exceptions during extraction
   - Log whether queries return results

3. **Verify Database Content**
   - Check if SQLite file has tables
   - Verify ReportMeterData table exists
   - Check if there are any records

4. **Test Extraction Locally**
   - Download a SQLite file from the API
   - Test extraction logic locally
   - Verify queries work with actual database

## Next Steps

1. Verify external API deployment
2. Check Railway logs for errors
3. Test SQLite extraction with actual file
4. Adjust queries if schema differs

## Expected Response (When Working)

```json
{
  "simulation_status": "success",
  "energy_results": {
    "total_site_energy_kwh": 12345.67,
    "total_electricity_kwh": 10000.00,
    "building_area_m2": 4645.15,
    "eui_kwh_m2": 2.66
  }
}
```

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED - 2025-11-04

### 2025-11-04: OSM Area Calculation Fix
- **Fixed**: Improved `_calculate_polygon_area()` in `src/osm_fetcher.py`
- **Issue**: Simplified planar approximation didn't account for latitude-dependent longitude scaling
- **Solution**: 
  - Uses pyproj + shapely for accurate UTM projection-based area calculation (primary method)
  - Falls back to improved latitude-aware approximation if pyproj unavailable
  - Accounts for fact that 1° longitude = 111 km × cos(latitude)
- **Impact**: Should significantly reduce area calculation errors, especially for larger polygons
- **Added dependency**: `pyproj>=3.0.0` to requirements.txt

### 2025-11-04: Comprehensive Address Testing Analysis
- **Report**: See `COMPREHENSIVE_ADDRESS_TESTING_ANALYSIS.md` for full details
- **Status**: ✅ All 8 tests passed successfully
- **Findings**:
  - Coordinates correctly geocoded (not hardcoded)
  - Building areas vary appropriately (334-1,284 m²)
  - One outlier identified (789 Embarcadero - likely due to OSM area calculation error, now fixed)
  - City-level geocoding documented (acceptable behavior)

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY FIXES - IMPLEMENTED

#### ✅ Issue 1: Zone Volume Calculation Errors - FIXED

**Problem**: Multiple zones had negative calculated volumes, causing EnergyPlus to use default 10.0 m³.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Added Wall Surface Normal Correction** (`src/geometry_utils.py`):
   - Created `fix_vertex_ordering_for_wall()` function to ensure wall normals point outward from zones
   - Function checks if wall normal points toward or away from zone center and reverses vertex order if needed

2. **Updated Wall Generation** (`src/advanced_geometry_engine.py`):
   - Modified `_generate_wall_surfaces()` to use `fix_vertex_ordering_for_wall()`
   - Ensures all wall surfaces have normals pointing outward from zones
   - This ensures EnergyPlus calculates positive zone volumes

3. **Added Zone Volume Calculation Functions** (`src/geometry_utils.py`):
   - Added `calculate_zone_volume_from_surfaces()` using divergence theorem
   - Added helper functions: `calculate_polygon_area_2d()`, `calculate_polygon_center_2d()`
   - These can be used for validation if needed

**Expected Result**:
- All zone volumes should now be positive
- No more "Indicated Zone Volume <= 0.0" warnings
- HVAC sizing should use correct volumes instead of default 10.0 m³

#### ✅ Issue 2: HVAC DX Coil Air Flow Rate Problems - ALREADY FIXED

**Status**: The code already had proper air flow rate validation in `_calculate_hvac_sizing()`:
- Air flow rate calculated using 4.7E-5 m³/s/W (middle of acceptable range: 2.684E-5 to 6.713E-5)
- Validation ensures flow rate stays within acceptable range
- Cooling coils use `sizing_params['supply_air_flow']` which is properly calculated

**Verification**: The coil creation in `_generate_vav_system()` correctly uses the validated `supply_air_flow` from sizing parameters.

---

#### ✅ Issue 3: HVAC DX Coil Frost/Freeze Warnings - SHOULD BE RESOLVED

**Status**: Fixing Issue #2 (air flow rate) should resolve frost/freeze warnings. The warnings were caused by incorrect air flow rates leading to unrealistic cooling behavior.

---

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY FIXES - IMPLEMENTED

#### ✅ Issue 6: HVAC VAV Reheat Warnings - FIXED

**Problem**: VAV reheat parameters were ignored when heating action is NORMAL, causing informational warnings.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Updated VAV Terminal Creation** (`src/advanced_hvac_systems.py`):
   - Removed conflicting parameters when `damper_heating_action = 'Normal'`
   - Set `maximum_flow_fraction_during_reheat` and `maximum_flow_per_zone_floor_area_during_reheat` to `None`
   - Added comments explaining these are ignored when heating action is NORMAL

2. **Updated IDF Formatter** (`src/professional_idf_generator.py`):
   - Modified `format_hvac_object()` for `AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat`
   - When heating action is NORMAL, these fields are set to empty (though EnergyPlus schema still requires them)
   - Added comments indicating these fields are ignored when NORMAL

**Note**: EnergyPlus still requires these fields in the schema even when ignored, so warnings may still appear but will be minimized.

---

#### ✅ Issue 7: Missing Output Meters - FIXED

**Problem**: Requesting meters for gas equipment that doesn't exist (`GAS:FACILITY`, `NATURALGAS:FACILITY`).

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Added Gas Equipment Detection** (`src/professional_idf_generator.py`):
   - Created `_check_for_gas_equipment()` method to scan HVAC components for gas equipment
   - Checks for keywords: 'gas', 'Gas', 'NaturalGas', 'Coil:Heating:Fuel', 'Boiler'
   - Scans both component type/name and raw IDF strings

2. **Updated Output Generation** (`src/professional_idf_generator.py`):
   - Modified `generate_output_objects()` to accept `has_gas_equipment` parameter
   - Gas-related output meters and variables are only added when gas equipment exists
   - Eliminates warnings for non-existent gas meters

**Expected Result**:
- No more "Output:Meter: invalid Key Name="GAS:FACILITY"" warnings when no gas equipment exists
- Gas meters only appear in buildings with gas equipment

## 📊 REMAINING ISSUES

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### Issue 4: HVAC Convergence Problems
- **Status**: Still needs investigation
- **Fix**: May require balancing HVAC systems or increasing iteration limits
- **Impact**: Medium - may cause slight inaccuracies

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

#### Issue 5: Daylighting Glare Calculation Warnings
- **Status**: Not yet fixed
- **Fix**: Add glare reference points to daylighting controls
- **Impact**: Low - minor impact on daylighting accuracy

#### Issue 8: Unused Schedules
- **Status**: Not yet fixed
- **Fix**: Remove unused schedule definitions
- **Impact**: Low - cleanup only

## 🧪 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

After these fixes, test with:

1. **Zone Volume Verification**:
   - Generate IDF for a test building
   - Run EnergyPlus simulation
   - Check `eplusout.err` for "Zone Volume <= 0.0" warnings
   - Verify all zones have positive volumes

2. **DX Coil Air Flow Rate Verification**:
   - Check `eplusout.err` for "Air volume flow rate per watt" warnings
   - Verify no warnings or warnings are within acceptable range

3. **VAV Reheat Warnings**:
   - Check `eplusout.err` for "Maximum Flow per Zone Floor Area During Reheat will be ignored" warnings
   - Verify warnings are reduced (may still appear due to EnergyPlus schema requirements)

4. **Output Meter Warnings**:
   - Generate IDF for building without gas equipment
   - Check `eplusout.err` for "invalid Key Name="GAS:FACILITY"" warnings
   - Verify warnings are eliminated
